        FUSE to libsmb2 bridge
        ----------------------

This code is the bare minimum to access a read-only SMB share via a fuse mount.
It should work under:

Linux   - using libfuse: https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse
Windows - using winfsp:  https://github.com/winfsp/winfsp

Once built, you should be able to mount a folder using the syntax:

    fuse_libsmb2 -f --uri://user:password@hostname/share /some/local/mountpoint

At the current time my local fork of libsmb2 has a bunch of windows fixes:

Use the "all-fixes" branch for... you guessed it... all of my fixes merged together.
